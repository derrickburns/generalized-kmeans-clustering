# Generalized K-Means Clustering

This project generalizes the Spark MLLIB Batch K-Means (v1.1.0) clusterer and the Spark MLLIB Streaming K-Means (v1.2.0) clusterer.&#x20;

Most practical variants of K-means clustering are implemented or can be implemented with this package.

If you find a novel variant of k-means clustering that is provably superior in some manner, implement it using the package and send a pull request along with the paper analyzing the variant!

This code has been tested on data sets of tens of millions of points in a 700+ dimensional space using a variety of distance functions. Thanks to the excellent core Spark implementation, it rocks!
