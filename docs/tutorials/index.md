## Getting Started

| Tutorial | Time | What You'll Learn |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| [Your First Clustering](first-clustering.html) | 5 min | Basic clustering with Spark ML |
| [PySpark Tutorial](pyspark-tutorial.html) | 10 min | Python API for clustering |
| [Choosing the Right Algorithm](choosing-algorithm.html) | 15 min | Decision guide for 15 algorithms |

## By Use Case

### Probability Distributions
- [Clustering Documents with KL Divergence](kl-divergence.html) — Topic modeling approach

### Time Series
- [Clustering Sensor Data](time-series.html) — DTW-based sequence clustering

### Large Scale
- [Billion-Point Clustering](large-scale.html) — Mini-batch and streaming

### Semi-Supervised
- [Clustering with Constraints](constraints.html) — Must-link and cannot-link

---

## Prerequisites

All tutorials assume:
- Apache Spark 3.4+ installed
- Scala 2.13 or Python 3.8+
- Basic familiarity with DataFrames
