# Scaladoc Generation Issue (RESOLVED)

## Resolution

**âœ… RESOLVED**: The project has been upgraded to Scala 2.13.14 as the default version, which resolves the scaladoc compiler bug. Documentation generation now works correctly.

## Original Problem (Scala 2.12.18)

Scaladoc generation failed with Scala 2.12.18 due to a compiler bug when processing `XORShiftRandom.scala`:

```
[error] java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed:
[error]   while compiling: .../XORShiftRandom.scala
```

## Root Cause

This is a known Scala 2.12 scaladoc compiler bug that occurs with certain code patterns. The file `XORShiftRandom.scala` is a copy of Spark's internal XORShift random number generator and triggers this bug.

## Attempted Fixes

1. **Excluding file from scaladoc**: Added filter to exclude XORShiftRandom.scala from doc sources
2. **Removing -diagrams flag**: The `-diagrams` flag was removed as it can trigger additional compiler issues
3. **Adding -no-link-warnings**: Suppress warnings about broken documentation links

## Current Workaround

The docs workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) is currently disabled or configured to skip scaladoc generation until this issue can be resolved.

## Potential Solutions

1. **Upgrade to Scala 2.13**: Scala 2.13 has a more robust scaladoc compiler that doesn't have this bug
2. **Rewrite XORShiftRandom**: Refactor the file to avoid the pattern that triggers the compiler bug
3. **Use external documentation tool**: Consider using a third-party documentation generator that doesn't rely on scaladoc
4. **Generate docs only for Scala 2.13**: Configure the workflow to only generate documentation when building with Scala 2.13

## Recommended Approach

The best solution is to upgrade the project to Scala 2.13 as the primary version, which will resolve this issue along with providing other improvements.

## Files Affected

- `src/main/scala/com/massivedatascience/util/XORShiftRandom.scala` - The problematic file
- `build.sbt` - Contains doc configuration and exclusion filters
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Documentation generation workflow
